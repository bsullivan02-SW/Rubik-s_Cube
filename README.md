In this repository we were close to getting Breadth First search and Depth First search to work to solve a cube in cube.py. Cube_original.py is a file that scrambles and solves a cube in around one hundred moves, not using AI techniques. We took the GUI from Cube_original.py to have a visual for a cube. We then looked at a cube/state in Cube_original.py to see if we could solve it only using Breadth First search. If we were able to implement the Breadth First search method, we would be able to unscramble the cube. We also use the scrabble function to change the amount of moves performed during a scramble. We assume that (with the methods working well) we could solve any cube that is scrambled and output a moveset in twenty moves or less. The Cube_original.py is able to solve a cube and output its solutions but the movesets are too long for our liking and you can not change the amount of moves performed during the scramble fase.
